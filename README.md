Monster Trainer Game
A Pokémon-style command-line adventure where you explore, catch, and battle creatures!
Overview
Monster Trainer is a Python-based, text adventure game inspired by the Pokémon series.
Players can explore a small virtual world, encounter wild monsters, catch them, train their team, and engage in turn-based battles. The game also includes a basic storyline that progresses as the player explores new areas and wins battles.
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python — such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation — to create an interactive and replayable experience.

•	Exploration System – Move through different zones and discover wild monsters.
•	Monster Capture – Try to catch wild monsters using capture items.
•	Turn-Based Battles – Each monster has unique stats and attack moves.
•	Training & Leveling Up – Win battles to earn experience and make your monsters stronger.
•	Story Progression – Follow simple story updates as you explore the world.
•	Save/Load System (optional or planned) – Continue your adventure later.

Technologies Used
•	Python 3.x
•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
o	Classes for Player, Monster, Battle, etc.
o	Methods and attributes for stats, attacks, and moves.
•	Random Module for wild encounters and battle outcomes.
